<div class="content">

  <p>John Falconer lived in the 17th century (1). In his lifetime he got tired of that only a few people could read cryptic script, and decided to make it available for a larger group of people. He wrote the book Cryptomenysis PatefactaIn, where he explains a number of different code languages that can be used in script, speech and with hand gestures.<br><br> On this website, you can use one of his languages, based on a Bi-literary Alphabet (2). It is modified so that all letters have a direction based on their pronounced sound. Letters that are pronounced similarly have the same direction (3).

<button class="collapsible">start typing</button>
<div class="content2">
  <p>You can start typing on your keyboard right away. The purpose of this website is to allow users to write stupid things that never need to be read unless you want it to be. Be aware that some letters have a steep angle upwards or downwards. If you are typing outside the window you can navigate back by using "=" to go up and "+" to go down. <br><br> The controllers are here to give the user some control over the visual outcome of their writing. If the user would want, they can change color to split up paragraphs or to show that they are writing in a different language. They can change size to pronounce something a bit louder or to show that they are whispering.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">send it away</button>


<div class="content3">
  <p>If the user would want to translate it into a text that is more readable there are a few different ways. One can decipher it with the specimen in Falconer's book. Or, the user can look at the console log in developer tools. However, the easiest way is to copy the text and paste it into a text editor. 

If the user would want to print this there is a possibility to export it as a pdf.</p>
